# Welcome to RUSTREAM

## Multi-platform screen-casting
PDS project of an application written in rust to host and watch a streaming in rust

### Description
Using the Rust programming language, create a screencasting application capable of continuously
grabbing the content of the screen (or a portion of it) and stream it to a set of peers.

The application should fulfill the following requirements:
1. [x] Platform Support: The utility should be compatible with multiple desktop operating systems,
including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
2. [x] User Interface (UI): The utility should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows
users to easily navigate through the application's features.
3. [x] Operating mode: At startup, the user will choose whether the application should operate as a
caster or as a receiver. In the latter case, the user should be able to specify the address of the
caster it should connect to.
4. [x] Selection Options: When in casting mode, the utility should allow the user to restrict the
grabbed content to a custom area.
5. [x] Hotkey Support: The utility should support customizable keyboard shortcuts for
pausing/resuming the transmission, for blanking the screen and terminating the current session.


### As a bonus, the application may also provide the following features:

6. [x] Annotation Tools: When in casting mode, the utility can activate/deactivate a transparent
layer on top of the grabbed area where annotations like shapes, arrows, text, …, can be
superimposed to the original content.
7. [x] Save Options: When in receiving mode, the utility should allow users to record the received
content to a video file.
8. [x] Multi-monitor Support: The utility should be able to recognize and handle
multiple monitors independently, allowing users to cast content from any of the connected
displays. 


## Installation

1. First clone the vcpkg 

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
```

2. install the ffmpeg libraries
   
```bash
vcpkg install ffmpeg:x64-windows
```

3. (Optional) Integrate the installed library 

```bash
vcpkg integrate install
```
3. Add to the path the following:
Inside `vcpkg/installedx64-windows` 

There should be two folders:
  - bin
  - include 

Add both folder to the system path

(Not sure is needed) Additionally set two additional system variable with the previous added path
- `FFMPEG_DIR` variable should be set with the path of the `bin` path from before
- `FFMPEG_INCLUDE_DIR` variable should be set with the path of the `include` path from before
